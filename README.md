# cerebro-dl
A deep learning library based on Theano

The minimum set of dependencies are

- Python 2.7 or later
- A suitable C/C++ compiler (GCC is recommended)
- [numpy](http://numpy.org)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) 0.15.2 or later
- [scipy](http://scipy.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) 0.16
- [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)

It is highly recommended to use Python distribution such as [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) for easy environment setup.

In addition, optimized version of some packages are available for academic use
